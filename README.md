# BlendAI

**Automate Geometry Nodes creation in Blender using AI agents.**

This project leverages the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to turn natural language prompts into 3D procedural geometry. Instead of manually wiring nodes, simply ask the AI to create a "Geometry Node Setup" you want and watch it building the node tree in real-time directly inside Blender.

## 🚀 How It Works
The system uses a **Multi-Agent Architecture** to ensure high-quality, functional node trees:

1.  **🧠 The Architect Agent:** Analyzes your request and the current scene context to plan the node logic.
2.  **💻 The Developer Agent:** Writes the Python code (`bpy`) to physically build and link the node tree.
3.  **🔄 Self-Correction Loop:** If the generated code fails (e.g., incorrect socket names), the agent reads the error trace, researches the correct Blender API, and automatically fixes its own code.

## 🛠️ Installation Guide
### Prerequisites
*   **Blender 4.0+** (Installed and accessible)
*   **Python 3.10+** (Installed on your system)
*   A **Google Gemini API Key**

---

This Setup is for *Windows* only. 

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Choose your folder, where you want to download the files of this software.
Then, run these commands in VS Code 'cmd' terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/SV005/BlendAI.git
```

### Step 2: Create a viruel python environment.
To install the dependencies create a seperate python virtual environment (venv). 

```
python -m venv venv
```
Then Activate it.
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries from requirements.txt file.
```
pip install -r agent_service\requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure API Key
1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root directory.
2.  Add your Gemini API key in this file:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    ```

### Step 5: Setup Blender Add-on
1.  Open Blender.
2.  Go to **Edit** -> **Preferences** -> **Add-ons**.
3.  Click **Install...** and select the `addon.zip` zipped folder from this repo.
4.  Enable the add-on by checking the box.
5.  Open the **Sidebar (N-Panel)** in the 3D Viewport and find the **"AI Agent"** tab.
6.  Click the **Start Server** button to initialize the Blender-side socket listener.

## ⚡ Usage

### 1. Run the Agent Server
In your VS Code cmd terminal, ensure your virtual environment is active, and run the agent service:
```
python -m agent_service.src.main
```
*This starts the backend that communicates between the AI and Blender.*

### 2. Ask AI in Blender
1.  Go to the Blender and select a Mesh object in the 3D Viewport.
2.  Go to the **AI Agent** panel.
3.  Type your prompt.
    *   *Example:* `"Add a UV Sphere and Extrude it's faces with Offset 1."`
4.  Click **Ask**.

After a moment of processing, the AI will create a new Geometry Nodes modifier on your object with the requested node setup!
